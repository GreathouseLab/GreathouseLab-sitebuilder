# Obesity Prevention

Obesity is a disease affecting more than one-third of our population, and is on the rise in countries with improving economies. 
We know that as people adopt Western lifestyles, both their diet and microbiome change dramatically, increasing obesity incidence. 
Dietary intake is one the most important factors shaping our resident microbial ecosystem, which also contributes to obesity development. 
We have been conducting studies to better understand the relationship between dietary intake, the microbiome, and weight gain. 
Currently, we are conducting a dietary fiber intervention among medical residents to study the effect on weight gain, body composition changes, appetite hormones.
