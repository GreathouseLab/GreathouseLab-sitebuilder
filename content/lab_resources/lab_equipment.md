-80 C freezer 

* Whenever ice builds up on the edges and corners of inside doors, use ice scraper to remove. If this is not performed, doors can be damaged. 
* Unit will vacuum seal after opening, if you need to open it again, turn the knob on the left side of the unit to release the vacuum seal. 
* This dial has an ice pick for when ice builds up. If can be used from the inside or the outside. However, due to the location of the unit, from the inside will be most efficient. Life the bottom of the top freezer to access the area. 
* Inside doors are removable, if they build up ice, remove them and put them in the sink. Since both doors are the same size, it does not matter if you interchange them.

Incubators

* Shelves go in so that the with lip facing down is facing you 
* CO2 stops blowing when outer door opens
* Cleaning 70% ethanol or 10% bleach but NOT recommended
* Water pan has cover to direct air flow
* Wipe down back (take off panels) before start it up
* Cold finger condenses and it drips down to pan
* Little bit of condensation is ok
* Lots of condensation is bad, check that out
* Copper and UV light to help prevent contamination
* UV light is safe to use, comes on for 10 min after door is opened
* If bad contamination, take everything out, autoclave everything and leave UV light on for 24 hours

Filter for DI and Molecular grade water

* Let me know if any of the DI water lights are red continuously. I will Call Evoqua for replacement 

CO2 Tank 

* when on, left gauge should read between 5 and 10 psi. (tube pressure) Left gauge should read between 1000 and 500 psi (tank pressure)
* blue/green knob is the control to the tube to the incubator; the left gauge corresponds to the pressure in the tube
* black knob is turned completely to the left; turning to the right increases tank pressure
* to turn tank on and off, see open/close valve located at top of tank
* to shut off co2 to incubators, make sure green/blue valve is turned down 

Autoclave

1.	Check the water level on the front exhaust tank. If it is at high level mark, replace with fresh water up to the low level mark. Be careful about the position of the exhaust hose. 
2.	Turn the power switch to on. Ensure that pressure gauge reads 0 MPa. Ensure that the cover lock light is not lit. 
3.	Open the cover. 
4.	Make sure the drain valve (underneath exhaust tank) is closed. Pour water (normal sink water) into the chamber until the water level is slightly below the heating cover surface (approx. 3.5 L) 
5.	Place autoclave tape over item (caps should be loose!). Place items to be sterilized inside the basket(s), ensuring they are not overlapping. Place basket(s) inside chamber (smaller basket on top). 
6.	Make sure the digital display shows a temperature below 60 degrees C. 
7.	Close the cover. 
8.	Use the select button to select one of the 4 sterilization cycles [1) liquid, 2) steri., 3) melt, 4) instrument.] Then use the arrow buttons to select the specific program within the cycle (1, 2, or 3.) Refer to list to determine the different programs/cycles. For Biohazard trash use program for liquid sterilization and double bag! Afterwards place in black trash bag and put in standard lab trash can for pick up
9.	Press the start button if no further modifications to settings needed.

After cycle is completed
    
10.	Buzzer will sound. Ensure that the pressure is lowered to 0 MPa and that the cover lock lamp is not lit.
11.	 Pull up the handle slightly to open the cover and wait until no steam comes out. Then open the cover slowly.  
12.	Take out the sterilization objects when steam has been purged completely from the chamber. Make sure they are cool first! Or use autoclave gloves.
13.	Set the power switch to off. 
14.	Drain off the heating water by opening the cover, opening the drain valve. 
15.	Close the drain valve after draining water.
