If you are participating in or working data from studies with human subjects, you MUST complete CITI train BEFORE working with any subjects or data:
 
### IBC Required Training

IBC regulatory training for all investigators and lab personnel in BSL1, BSL2, or BSL3 Labs is completed through CITI. All required CITI training should be completed before submitting protocols to the IBC. Incomplete training will delay review and approval. Many additional IBC training modules are available to investigators through CITI. The IBC encourages investigators to access these modules as you see fit to facilitate your own research or instruction, and to use them as a resource in your teaching and mentoring of student investigators.
